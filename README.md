# Program Description

This is Streamline, but with a graphical interface!

This version of Streamline will open in a windiw on your
computer with colorful squares and circles to make your gaming
experience a little bit more enjoyable.

In Streamline GUI, you — the player — are a blue square, and
you're trying to get to the goal, which is a teal square.

Obstacles are in your way though, and they're gray squares in
Streamline GUI.

Try to get around the gray squares to get your blue square to
the green square! (The blue circles represent your trail.)

# Short Response

Unix / Linux Questions:

1. mkdir fooBar fooBar/dirDir

2. rm *.java
Removes all of the .java files in the current directory.

3. ls -aR

JavaFX Questions:

1. You could use lambda expressions to define the event handler
to pass into setOnKeyPressed. In this appoach, for some object
in question "e" that will eventually be called, you can operate
on an initialized event handler to execute tasks on keystrokes
pressed while the scene is active.

2. The Group class serves to store all of the objects that get
placed on the grid in an organized fashion. You can add objects
to it and remove those objects. Those objects are, like, the
Player object, instaces of RoundedSquare, and potentially others
(but that's probably it for this programming assignment).
This is efficient for getting a group of objects at once to 
display onto the scene.
